# fitr

A package for fitting reinforcement learning models to behavioural data.

Currently, only the Matlab version is functional, but I am refining its performance as well as documentation.

I am also working on writing versions for python and Julia, but currently the Matlab version is my main priority. Neither the python nor Julia versions are usable at the moment.

Some of the code is based on Samuel Gershman's `mfit` package, which I highly recommend.
