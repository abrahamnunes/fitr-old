# fitr

A package for fitting reinforcement learning models to behavioural data.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Currently, the Matlab version is functional, but I am refining its performance as well as documentation.

I am also working on writing versions for python and Julia, but currently the Matlab version is my main priority.

Some of the code is based on Samuel Gershman's `mfit` package, which I highly recommend.

Based on the code in my `edo-mbmf-rl` repo

## Most pressing issues/to-do's
- [] Improve optimization (slow, inaccurate at the moment)
- [] Develop model class, rather than using so many nested dictionaries
- [] ? matlab port?
