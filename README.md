A package for fitting reinforcement learning models to behavioural data.

Some of the code is based on Samuel Gershman's `mfit` package, which I highly recommend.

Currently, __only the Matlab version is functional__, and I am refining its performance as well as documentation.

I am also working on writing versions for python and Julia, but currently the Matlab version is my main priority. __Neither the python nor Julia versions are usable at the moment.__
