  "body": "The `fitr` package is a tool for fitting reinforcement learning (RL) models to behavioural data. Currently, it's in _very_ early stages of development, and __only the Matlab package is presently functional__. There is not yet any documentation, but we're working on that.\r\n\r\nMuch credit is owed to Samuel Gershman for his [`mfit` package](https://github.com/sjgershm/mfit) from which I learned a great deal about implementing RL model fitting. Currently, the `fitr` Bayesian Model Selection code uses many of the functions from `mfit`, but an independent implementation is underway.\r\n\r\nI am working on the python and Julia packages, but improving the quality of the Matlab version is currently my main priority. \r\n\r\nFuture goals include:\r\n\r\n* Documentation\r\n* Built-in gradient computations for common models\r\n* Bridging with tools such as SPM and VBA-Toolbox\r\n* Expanding base of built-in tasks\r\n* Improving speed by fitting subjects in parallel\r\n* Exploring GPU-acceleration\r\n\r\n### References\r\n\r\n1.
